# Reviews Challenge: jQuery and Parse

This folder contains your submission for the [reviews challenge](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/challenges/reviews). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. Who did you pair with to test your application? #####
> Mitchell Amundsen from Section D

##### 2. Did you fix or learn anything from pair-testing your program? #####
> I learned that the review site does work and updates when used at the same time.  Deleting/Up Vote/Down Vote still had bugs of deleting/updating only the first item of the review list.

##### 3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> I asked a lot of people for help but off the top of my head: Isabella, Meera, Natasha, Holden, Daniel Hoang, Mitchell Amundsen

##### 4. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I embeded a YouTube video and used that as my review subject.

##### 5. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> It's not 100% done, BUT so far 25 hours.

##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> The assignment was very difficult.  It wasn't the assignment itself but the lack of understanding the "language" to get the challenge done.  A more in-depth teaching of jQuery would've been very helpful.
