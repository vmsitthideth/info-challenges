# Git Challenge

This folder contains the some starter files (nicely organized!) for the INFO 343 git tutorial/challenge. See the [git challenge page](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/challenges/git) for details on what to do with the files in this folder.

In the future, you'll be modifying this file to include details about your challenge submission. But for now, you should just make the small change specified in the challenge write-up!

Hey Holden!  Hope you're looking forward to TAing us!  This class is going to be so much fun.
