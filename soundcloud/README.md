##### 1. What is the purpose of your application? Give a 1-2 sentence pitch of what your system is about! #####
> MUSIC-FINDER is an easy to use search application for SoundCloud tracks!  It'll let users find their favorite songs, check out an uploader's page, and link to purchasing the song (if available).

##### 2. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> Yes!  I asked Meera and Brittney for help!

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I was not able to... but if I would like to attempt them on my spare time!

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> 10 hours

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> Understanding the SoundCloud API was a bit confusing at first because there is a lot of information and it is very spread out.  I think a 'hint' on where someone might look would relieve frustration in the future.
